These 2 projects are based on the [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) prelearned model. The transfer learning was applied to it using the
[Playing Card Image Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/augmented-startups/playing-cards-ow27d) and the [Construction Site Safety Image Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/construction-site-safety/dataset/27).
